# my-portfolio

## This is my first portfolio created to show a quick description about me, my projects I've worked on, and a way to contact me.

I  created this portfolio with the intention of being able to show future employers the projects I've worked on and the skills that I have and am currently honing.

I learned that creating containers and adding CSS to these containers can be difficult, but allow your information to be displayed in a more aesthetically pleasing way.

## Credits

I collaborated with Jeff Parker and Tudor Tocan for this project. I also used https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/#theprojectfolderstructure website to help with direction for this project.

I also used a zero royalty website for my "Coming Soon" picture.
