        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Joshua Zabihian. I am from San Antonio, Texas and have
          lived here my entire life. My interests include: traveling, eating
          good food, watching anime, and playing videogames. I worked for a
          dealership group for 2 years and learned many skills throughout this
          period. The skills that were most necessary are the following:
          communication, organization, and attention to detail. I am currently
          trying to learn how to become a programmer in the hopes of finding a
          stable and remote job.

          This is the Horiseon website that contained code for me to refactor to
          give better accesibility and enhance SEO. There were many non-semantic
          elements that needed to be replaced with semantic elements.

          This is a study guide that I created with the help of the UTSA
          bootcamp with the intention to help a student remember the basics of
          web development.
